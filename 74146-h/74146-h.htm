<p class="ph3">A MODE OF MEDICAL TREATMENT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Massage</span> as a hygienic agent was practised
from the earliest times, and is probably as old
as surgery itself, or, as it would be more exact
to say, as old as mankind. The word is derived
from the Greek to knead, and the Arabic to
press softly. A Chinese manuscript, the date of
which is three thousand years before the Christian
era, contains an account of operations similar to
those of the present day: friction, kneading,
manipulating, rolling—all the procedures now
grouped together under the name of massage.
The translator of this curious record, a French
missionary at Pekin, finds it to include all the
characteristics of an ancient scientific mode of
treatment; and it has been wittily remarked,
that however it may rejuvenate those who submit
to its influence, the wrinkles of time cannot be
removed from its own ancient visage.</p>

<p>With the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, a
form of massage was the common accompaniment
of the bath, and was used as a luxury, as a means
of hastening tedious convalescence, and to render
the limbs supple and enduring. Rubbing and
anointing were sometimes done by medical practitioners
themselves, or by the priests, or sometimes
by slaves. Herodicus, one of the masters of
Hippocrates in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, first proposed
gymnastics as a cure for disease. He was
the superior officer of the gymnasium at Athens;
and by compelling his patients to undergo various
exercises and to have their bodies rubbed, is said
to have lengthened their lives, insomuch that
Plato reproached him for protracting that existence,
in which, as years advanced, they could
have less and less enjoyment. He himself, by the
practice of his own remedies, attained the age
of a hundred.</p>

<p>The earliest definite information regarding
massage comes from Hippocrates, who says:
‘The physician must be experienced in many
things, but assuredly also in rubbing; for things
that have the same name have not always the
same effects, for rubbing can bind a joint that
is too loose, and loosen a joint that is too rigid.’
He also used the word <i>anatripsis</i>, the process of
rubbing <i>up</i>, and not <i>down</i>, although not understanding
the reason of it, as it was not till five
hundred years later that Galen pointed out that
the arteries were not filled with air, as their name
would seem to imply. Asclepiades was probably
not far wrong when he founded his school at
Rome on the belief that diet, bathing, exercise,
and friction should keep the body without disease;
and Cicero affirmed that he owed as much of
his health to his anointer as he did to his
physician. Plutarch tells us that Julius Cæsar
had himself pinched all over daily, as a means
of getting rid of a general neuralgia. Celsus, at
the beginning of the Christian era, advised that
rubbing should be applied to the whole body,
‘when an invalid requires his system to be
replenished;’ and Pliny availed himself of a mode
of treatment which was evidently much in fashion
in his day, and derived so much benefit from
the remedy, that he obtained for his physician,
who was a Jew, the privileges of Roman citizenship.
It is related of the Emperor Hadrian that
one day seeing a veteran soldier rubbing himself
against the marble at the public baths, he asked
him why he did so. The veteran answered: ‘I
have no slave to rub me.’ Whereupon, the
emperor gave him two slaves and sufficient to
maintain them. It is quaintly added to this story,
that the next day several old men rubbed themselves
against the wall in the emperor’s presence,
when, perceiving their object, he shrewdly
directed them to rub one another.</p>

<p>The works of Plato abound in references to
the use of friction; and numberless passages might
be cited from celebrated writers describing the
hygienic exercises of the gymnasium, and the
manner in which children were led by degrees
to execute the most difficult evolutions without
fear or risk of fracture. In describing the course
pursued, friction, pressure, malaxation, are all in
turn noticed by different authors, and strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">{594}</span>
recommended. The Egyptians were probably the
first among civilised nations to put the system
into practice, and they were copied by the Greeks
and Romans. Savary, in his <i>Lettres sur l’Egypt</i>,
describes part of the process: ‘After the bath
and a short interval of repose, whilst the limbs
retain a soft moisture, an attendant presses them
gently, and when each limb has become supple
and flexible, the joints are cracked without effort;
il masse et semble paîtrir la chaire sans que l’on
éprouve la plus legère douleur.’</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, Henry II. of France
decreed that a treatise should be written upon
the hygienic exercises of ancient Rome. Six
years later, Mercurialis took up the question from
a medical point of view; after which, Ambrose
Paré, the most renowned surgeon of the sixteenth
century, dilated on the value of the works of
Oribasius, written in the time of the Emperor
Julian; and he described three kinds of friction
and the effects of each, and was thought so skilful,
that although a devout Huguenot, he was spared
at the massacre of St Bartholomew.</p>

<p>To Peter Henrik Ling is given the credit of
having instituted the ‘Swedish movement cure.’
He was even thought to have invented it; but
he simply founded his system on the <i>Kong Fau</i>
manuscript, which is not only the Chinese system,
but that of the Brahmins, the Egyptian priests,
and the Greek and Roman physicians. M. Dally
has characterised his theory and practice as
nothing more than a daguerreotype copy of the
<i>Kong Fau</i> of Tao-ssè, and called it a splendid
Chinese vase with its Chinese figures clothed in
European colours. Estradère, moreover, proves
that in the <i>San-tsai-tow-hoei</i>, published at the
end of the sixteenth century, there is to be
found a collection of engravings representing anatomical
figures and gymnastic exercises; amongst
these are figured frictions, pressures, percussions,
vibrations—massage itself, in fact. These movements
the Pekin missionaries affirm to have been
in use from time immemorial, and were employed
to dissipate the rigidity of the muscles occasioned
by fatigue, spasmodic contractions, and rheumatic
pains. The operators who practised this calling
had no fixed dwelling, but used to walk about
the streets, advertising their presence by the
clanking of a chain or by some sort of musical
instrument.</p>

<p>Lepage, in his historical researches on Chinese
medicine, relates that massage was a particular
practice borrowed from the Indians, and that it
was by such means that the Brahmins effected
their miraculous cures. The word shampooing
is of Hindu origin; but it must be borne in
mind that these Old-world practices were only
a faint foreshadowing of the present scientific
method. In his <i>Dictionnaire des Sciences Médicales</i>,
Piorry remarks that the simplest form of massage
prevails wherever the people have least outgrown
their primitive state; and travellers describe it
as universally common in countries where nature
alone dictates the remedy for accident or disease.
Captain Cook, in his voyage to Tahiti, describes
that on arriving they were hospitably received,
and that in the corner of a hut, carefully closed
over with reeds, a large piece of matting was
spread on the ground for them, and that their
legs and arms were rubbed and the muscles
softly pressed until all signs of fatigue had disappeared.
The <i>Gazette des Hôpitaux</i>, in 1839,
relates how massage is practised in the island of
Tonga: ‘When a person feels tired with walking
or any other exercise, he lies down, and his
servants go through the various operations known
under the names of Toogi-toogi, mili, or fota.
The first of these words expresses the action of
beating constantly and softly; the second, of
rubbing with the palm of the hand; the third,
of pressing and tightening the muscles between
the thumb and fingers. When the fatigue is
very great, young children are set to tread under
their feet the whole body of the patient.’</p>

<p>The lomi-lomi of the Sandwich Islanders is
much the same thing: the process is spoken
of as being that of neither kneading, squeezing,
nor rubbing, but now like one, and now like
the other. Dr N. B. Emerson relates that the
Hawaiians are a famous race of swimmers, and to
a foreigner seem amphibious. When wrecked,
they sometimes swim long distances; and if one
of their number becomes exhausted, they sustain
him in the water and lomi-lomi him. When
perfectly refreshed, they proceed upon their watery
way.</p>

<p>Baudin, in his <i>Travels in New Holland</i>, relates
that the individuals who have the greatest
influence amongst the savages are the <i>mulgaradocks</i>,
or medical charlatans. A mulgaradock is
regarded as possessing power over the elements
either to avert wind and rain, or to call down
tempests on the heads of those who come under
their displeasure. In order to calm a storm,
he stands in the open air, spreads out his arms,
shakes his mantle, made of skins, and gesticulates
violently for a considerable time. In order to
effect a cure, he proceeds much in the same way,
but with rather less noise: he practises a mode
of rubbing, and sometimes hits the patient with
green rods which have first been heated at a
fire, stopping at intervals to let the pain pass
away. The Africans follow the same fashion;
and with the Russians, flagellation and friction
by means of a bundle of birch twigs are resorted
to. After the subject has been well parboiled in
a vapour bath, a pailful of cold water is then
dashed over him, the effect of which is described
as electrifying. After this, he plunges into the
snow, and thus prepares himself to endure the
rigour of the climate with impunity. The Siberians
and Laplanders also are said to indulge in
these luxuries.</p>

<p>To France belongs the credit of giving to
modern medicine a scientific system of massage;
and yet, in spite of many able works, and various
discussions at the Academy of Sciences and other
learned societies, it remained a sort of secret
practice, almost wholly under the domain of
empiricism; but with the waning interest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">{595}</span>
French physicians, the Germans and Scandinavians
took up the subject; and about ten years
ago, Dr Mezger of Amsterdam brought massage
to be acknowledged as a highly valuable method.
He placed it upon the basis of practical knowledge,
thus taking it out of the hands of ignorant
charlatans. He did not write much about it,
but simply employed the teaching of facts. To
physicians who wrote to him for an explanation
of his treatment, he only said, ‘Come and see.’
To Professor von Mosengeil is owing the present
accurate and scientific knowledge of the subject;
by his careful and painstaking observations he
has brought massage into high esteem, so that
it is now acknowledged as a special branch of
the art of medicine.</p>

<p>There is, however, a pitfall to be avoided.
Dr William Murrell, in his recent practical work,
<i>Massage as a Mode of Treatment</i>, gives a very
necessary warning to those who would use it
ignorantly. He admits that it is not free from
the taint of quackery, and that the so-called
massage practised in some of our hospitals and
under the auspices of some nursing institutions
is a painful exhibition of ignorance and incompetence,
being simply a degenerate form of rubbing
or shampooing. Having lately witnessed
the progress of a number of cases under the care
of Professor Mosengeil in Germany, he remarks
that the massage of ‘medical rubbers’ is not
massage at all, as the term is understood on the
continent, and has little or nothing in common
with it. It is quite a mistake to think we can
take John from the stables and Biddy from the
washtub, and in one easy lesson convert either
into a safe, reliable, or efficient manipulator.
Dr Murrell has found it successful in various
kinds of paralysis; in writers’, painters’, and
dancers’ cramp; and in the cramp of telegraph
office operators, who, just as they have attained
to the highest point of dexterity, find that every
movement is performed with effort and pain, until
at last no movement is possible at all.</p>

<p>The chief advocates of massage have been men
of note; and although it is only recently that
it has gained an extensive scientific consideration,
it is gradually but surely obtaining a wider
circulation and a higher place as a worthy therapeutical
agent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> the city walls, hidden by the umbrella
pines, and back from those secluded walks where
young Rome takes its pleasure, stood the Villa
Salvarino, almost under the shade of the walls,
and hard by the gate of San Pancrazio. In
the more prosperous days of the Eternal City,
it might have been, and indeed was, the residence
of some great Roman family; but aristocracies
decline and families pass away; and the haughty
owners were by no means averse from making
a few English pounds by letting it to any
traveller who had the inclination or the means
to spend a few months there. The present
tenant at this bright Easter-time, Sir Geoffrey
Charteris, of Grosvenor Square, London, W., and
Haversham Park, in the county of Dorset, Baronet,
Deputy-lieutenant, and Justice of the Peace, was
a man of long descent. The pale azure fluid
in his veins was not the blood of us poor
mortals; his life-giving stream had been transmitted
through succeeding generations from a
long line of gallant warriors and gentle dames;
from fearless ancestors who followed their sovereign
at the call to arms, marched with Richard
of the Lion-heart to the Holy Sepulchre, and
maybe crossed swords with the doughty Saladin
himself. The title, conferred upon a Charteris
by the Black Prince in person after the glorious
field of Creçy, had known no tarnish as it
passed down the long line of great and good men,
soldiers, statesmen, and divines, to the present
worthy representative of all these honours. Not
that he had greatly distinguished himself in
any field, save as an Under-secretary in a short-lived
inglorious Ministry, where he had made
a lasting name as the most incompetent individual
ever appointed to office, though he
dated every subsequent event and prefixed
every after-dinner story by an allusion to the
time when he was in the Earl of Muddleton’s
Ministry.</p>

<p>The reception rooms of the villa were crowded
when our friends arrived. It was a kind of
informal after-dinner reception, attended by
most of the English visitors lingering after
the Carnival, with some sprinkling of the
resident aristocracy; for Sir Geoffrey liked to
gather people round him, birth and genius being
equally welcome. Sir Geoffrey looked every inch
an English gentleman, standing there among his
guests. He was apparently about fifty years of
age, tall and straight, thoroughbred from his stiff
gray hair to the small shapely feet, as yet
untroubled by the family gout. His eyes were
pale blue, and somewhat weak; his face, clear-cut
and refined, with an aquiline nose and a
high white forehead, but the whole marred by
a mouth weak and nervous to the last degree.
A connoisseur of art, a dabbler in literature, and
last, but not least, a firm believer in spiritualism.</p>

<p>Enid Charteris, his only daughter and heiress,
a girl about eighteen, must be taken for granted.
Imagine in all your dreams of fair women what
a golden-bronzed-haired girl should be, and you
have Enid, with all her charms of manner and
person, with that perfect expression without
which the most classic features are cold. She
smiled brightly as the new-comers entered. It
is not given to every one to be able to disguise
their likings and antipathies, and it did not
need a practised eye to see her cold greeting
for Le Gautier, and the instantaneous glance for
Maxwell.</p>

<p>‘I really began to think you were going to
fail me,’ she said; ‘and this is the last of our
receptions too. I shall always have pleasant
recollections of my visit to Rome.’</p>

<p>‘We have been dining with Maxwell, Miss
Charteris,’ Visci explained. ‘Could we forget
you, if we tried! And now, before you are so
engaged that you can have no word for poor
me, I want to ask you a favour. We are going
to my country retreat on Friday, and my sister
Genevieve is dying to see you. Do persuade
Sir Geoffrey to come.’</p>

<p>‘Here he is to answer for himself,’ she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">{596}</span>
as the baronet sauntered up to the group.—‘Papa,
you must promise to take me to see Signor Visci’s
country-house on Friday.—Do you hear?’</p>

<p>‘Anything you say is law, my dear,’ Sir Geoffrey
answered with comic resignation. ‘Anything
you desire.—Le Gautier, I wish to speak
to you,’ he whispered quietly; ‘come to me
presently.—Salvarini, you here? I thought you
had forsworn gaieties of all descriptions. Glad
to see you are thinking better of your misanthropy.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier turned off with the baronet somewhat
impatiently, leaving the rest together.
Salvarini, looking on somewhat thoughtfully,
almost fancied there was a look of relief in
Enid’s face as the Frenchman left; certainly,
she was less constrained.</p>

<p>‘We shall look forward to Friday with great
pleasure, then, Signor Visci,’ she said. ‘I have
heard you speak so much of the Villa Mattio,
that I am expecting to see a perfect paradise.’</p>

<p>‘With two Eves,’ Maxwell whispered in English.
Visci was not a man to misunderstand
the meaning of true company, so, with a bow
and a little complimentary speech, he turned
aside, taking Salvarini by the arm, and plunged
into the glittering crowd.</p>

<p>‘I do not understand the meaning there,’
Salvarini remarked as they walked through the
rooms. ‘If Maxwell means’——</p>

<p>‘Orange blossoms,’ Visci interrupted laconically;
‘and right, too.—Let us get into the
music-room. Le Fanu is going to play.’</p>

<p>Maxwell remained by Enid’s side, toying with
her fan and discoursing in their native language
in a low voice. From the expression in his face
and the earnest ring in his voice, there was no
doubting the power of the attraction that chained
him there.</p>

<p>‘When do you leave Rome, Miss Charteris?’
he asked, abruptly changing the conversation.
‘This is your last reception, I know.’</p>

<p>‘We shall leave in the middle of next week
for certain. I shall be very sorry for some
reasons, for I have been happy here.’</p>

<p>‘I shall probably return with you,’ Maxwell
observed. ‘I have deferred my departure too
long already. It would be pleasant to leave
together.’</p>

<p>‘After learning everything that Rome could
teach you,’ Enid put in archly. ‘Then the
Eternal City has no more artistic knowledge to
impart?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I have learned some lessons here,’ Maxwell
replied with a tender inflection, ‘besides
artistic ones. I have been learning one lately
that I am never likely to forget. Am I presumptuous,
Miss Enid?’</p>

<p>‘Really, Mr Maxwell, you are too mysterious.
If I could understand you’——</p>

<p>‘I think you do understand me; I fervently
hope you do.’</p>

<p>For a moment, a little wild-rose bloom trembled
and flushed on the girl’s cheek, then she looked
down, playing with her fan nervously. No
reason to say she did not understand now. Maxwell
did not follow up his advantage; some
instinct warned him not; and adroitly changing
the conversation, he told her of his life in Rome,
each passing moment linking his chains the
firmer. Gradually, as they sat talking, a group
of men gathered round, breaking in upon their
tête-à-tête, laughing and talking after the most
approved drawing-room fashion.</p>

<p>In a distant corner, Sir Geoffrey had button-holed
Le Gautier, and was apparently deep in
conversation on some all-absorbing subject. The
Frenchman was a good listener, with that rare
faculty of hearing all that was worthy of note
and entirely ignoring the superfluous. He was
not a man to talk much of himself, and consequently
heard a great deal of family history;
details and information that astute young man
had found valuable on occasions. He was interested
now, Maxwell thought, as he idly speculated
upon his face.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Sir Geoffrey was saying, ‘I am firmly
impressed with that belief.’ He had got upon his
favourite topic, and was talking with great volubility.
‘There are certain gifted beings who can
call spirits from the vasty deep, and, what is
more, the spirits will come. My dear sir, they
have been manifested to me.’</p>

<p>‘I should not wonder,’ Le Gautier replied,
stifling a yawn in its birth. ‘I think you are
quite right. I am what people call a medium
myself, and have assisted at many a séance.’</p>

<p>‘Of course you believe the same as I. Let
unbelievers scoff if they will, I shall always
believe the evidence of my eyes.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ Le Gautier returned politely, his
thoughts wandering feebly in the direction of
nightmare, and looking round for some means
of escape. ‘I have seen ghosts myself, or thought
I have.’</p>

<p>‘It is no imagination, Le Gautier,’ Sir Geoffrey
continued, with all the prosy earnestness of a
man with a hobby. ‘The strangest coincidence
happened to me. My late brother, Sir Ughtred,
who has been dead nearly twenty years, manifested
himself to me the other night. Surely
that implies some coming evil, or some duty I
have neglected?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps he charged you with some commission,’
Le Gautier observed, and pricking up
his ears for any scrap of useful information.</p>

<p>‘Not that I remember; indeed, I did not see
him for years before he died. He was an
eccentric man, and an extreme politician—in fact,
he got into serious trouble with the authorities,
and might even have been arrested, had he not
removed himself to New York.’</p>

<p>‘New York?’ queried Le Gautier, wondering
vaguely where he had heard of this Ughtred
Charteris before. ‘Was he connected with any
secret society—any Socialist conspiracy?’</p>

<p>‘Do you know, I really fancy he was,’ Sir
Geoffrey whispered mysteriously. ‘There were
certainly some curious things in his effects which
were sent to me. I can show you some now, if
you would like to see them.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier expressed his willingness; and the
baronet led the way into a small room at the
back of the house, half library, half studio. In
one corner was an old ebony cabinet; and opening
the front, he displayed a multitude of curiosities
such as a man will gather together in the
course of years. In one little drawer was a case
of coins. Le Gautier turned them over carelessly
one by one, till, suddenly starting, he eagerly
lifted one and held it to the light. ‘Where did
you get this?’ he asked abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">{597}</span></p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey took it in his hand. It was a
gold coin, a little larger than an ordinary sovereign,
and bearing on the reverse side a curious
device. ‘That came with the rest of my brother’s
curiosities.—But why do you ask? You look as
if the coin had burnt you.’</p>

<p>For a moment, Le Gautier had started back,
his pale face aglow with suppressed excitement;
but as he noticed the baronet’s wondering eyes
upon him, he recovered himself by a violent
effort. ‘It is nothing’—with a smile. ‘It is
only the coincidence which startled me for a
moment. If you will look here, you will see
that I wear a similar coin upon my watch-chain.’</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey looked down, and, surely enough,
on the end of Le Gautier’s pendant was the
fac-simile of the medal he held in his hand.</p>

<p>‘Bless me, what an extraordinary thing!’ the
startled baronet exclaimed. ‘So it is! Perhaps
you do not mind telling me where you procured
yours?’</p>

<p>‘It was given to me,’ Le Gautier replied, with
an enigmatic smile. ‘It could not help you, if
I told you.—Sir Geoffrey, may I ask you to lend
me this coin for a short while? I will tell you
some time what I want it for.’</p>

<p>‘Some other time, perhaps.’—Le Gautier threw
the coin into its place.—‘You see, I regard it
as a valuable curiosity and relic, or perhaps I
might part with it. You will pardon me.—But
I forgot all about our spiritualistic discourse.
As you are a medium, I will ask you’——</p>

<p>‘At some future time, with all the pleasure
in life,’ Le Gautier interrupted hastily. ‘Meanwhile,
it is getting late—past eleven now.’</p>

<p>As they walked back to the salon, the Frenchman
was busy with his thoughts. ‘What a
lucky find!’ he muttered. ‘It is the missing
insignia, sure enough, and the ill-fated Ughtred
Charteris is mine host’s brother. I wonder what
I can make out of this? There ought to be
something in it, with a feeble-minded man who
believes in spiritualism, if my hand has not lost
its cunning. <i>Nous verrons.</i>’</p>

<p>He showed nothing of his thoughts, however,
as he parted from Enid with a smile and neatly
turned compliment. It was getting late now;
the streets were empty as the friends turned
homeward, Salvarini bidding the others good-night
and turning off in the direction of his
apartments.</p>

<p>‘You had better change your mind, and come
with us on Friday, Hector,’ Visci urged Le
Gautier. ‘The baronet and his daughter are to
be of the party. Throw work to the dogs for
the day, and come.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Carlo, the thing is impossible. Do
you think I should be chained here this lovely
weather, if stern necessity did not compel? If
possibly I can get over later in the day, I will
not fail you.’</p>

<p>‘I am very sorry,’ Visci replied regretfully,
‘because this is the last time, in all probability,
our friends will meet together for some time.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry too, Carlo, but I cannot help it.
Good-night.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier watched his friend along the
moonlit street, a smile upon his face not pleasant
to see. ‘Ah, yes,’ he murmured, ‘it is quite
impossible. Genevieve is a good little girl, but
good little girls are apt to cloy. It is getting
dangerous. If Visci should find out, it would
be a case of twelve paces and hair-triggers; and
I cannot sacrifice myself yet—not even for
Genevieve.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ULSTER_PROVINCIALISMS">ULSTER PROVINCIALISMS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> people of Ulster may fairly claim a larger
share of public attention than has usually been
accorded to them: they have rendered their
province prosperous in a country which is a
stranger to prosperity; they have established
and maintained great industries in a country of
decayed trade and ruined commerce. In the
colonies, they have risen in a remarkable degree
to positions of affluence and authority; and in
all the British dominions, Ulstermen are found
in the van of commercial and professional life.</p>

<p>The Ulsterman comes of a very mixed descent.
Just as the Englishman was originally a compound
of Saxon, Norman, and Dane, so in the
Ulsterman’s veins flows the blood of Irish, Scotch,
and English progenitors. The relative proportion
of each element varies much according to locality
and religion. On the shores of Antrim and Down,
the population is in many places almost as purely
Scotch as in Ayrshire or Lanark. In Belfast,
Scotch blood predominates; but there was originally
a large English element. In Donegal and
Fermanagh, the Celtic element is in excess.
Everywhere, the Protestant derives more from
Scotch and English sources; the Roman Catholic,
from Irish.</p>

<p>From the earliest times, there has been a large
emigration from Scotland to the opposite Irish
shore. During the reigns of Elizabeth and James I.
the chief settlements from England took place;
and the settlers from both countries gradually
pushed back the original Irish inhabitants to the
mountains and into the interior. To this day,
there is a secluded district in County Antrim,
known as the Glens of Antrim, where the Irish
language may still be heard, although it has long
departed from other portions of the same county.
As we travel westward, Irish more frequently
meets the ear, and in many parts of Donegal it
is the prevailing tongue.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that in a province of such
varied lineage, provincialisms should be numerous
and curious. To guard against misconception, let
it be understood that the educated Ulsterman
speaks like educated people elsewhere—namely,
with perfect correctness and scarcely appreciable
accent. The peculiar words and phrases about
to be enumerated are heard almost exclusively
among the poorer ranks, or, if employed at all
by the educated classes, it is only in jest and
with a recognition of their provincial character.
The majority of them are of Scotch origin;
some are found in colloquial and provincial
English; while others are of Hibernian extraction.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As might have been expected, proverbs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">{598}</span>
proverbial expressions form a large class of these
provincialisms. ‘All to the one side, like Clogher,’
is an allusion to a town in County Tyrone where
all the houses and shops are on one side of the
thoroughfare, the opposite side being a private
demesne. ‘That bangs (surpasses) Banagher’ is
an allusion to the great fair held at that spot.
When the Ulsterman wishes to imply that a
certain event is extremely improbable, he says
that it will happen at ‘Tibb’s Eve,’ adding the
mysterious information that this is ‘neither before
nor after Christmas.’ This expression is a curiously
exact counterpart of the Latin phrase about
the Greek kalends. ‘As blunt as a beetle’ refers
to a species of heavy wooden mallet to which
Shakspeare alludes. ‘As busy as a nailer,’ ‘As
clean as a new pin,’ ‘As crooked as a ram’s horn,’
are common Ulster expressions, which do not call
for any explanation. A more mysterious expression
is the curious phrase, ‘As grave as a mustard-pot’—used
to express preternatural solemnity.
People of bilious complexion are often described
with more force than elegance as being ‘As
yellow as a duck’s foot.’</p>

<p>The Ulsterman has no special repute for gallantry,
yet his simile for anything exceptionally
simple is, ‘As easy as kiss.’ His favourite phrase
when about to impart some very confidential
information is, ‘Between you and me and the
post.’ A person whose sanity is open to question
is often described as ‘Wanting a square of being
round’—a curiously inexact expression. A person
who gapes with wide-mouthed wonder is said to
look ‘like a duck in thunder.’ Similarity of
political or religious opinion is expressed in
Ulster by saying that two people ‘Dig with the
same foot.’ ‘A dead man’s plunge’ is a peculiar
Ulster expression; it is applied to the short,
sudden, and rather hollow sound made by a
smooth flat pebble when it is tossed into the air
and falls into water upon its edge.</p>

<p>A large class of provincialisms are made up
of asseverative expressions. The Ulsterman often
prefaces his remarks by ‘Assay’ (I say) or ‘A’m
sayin’’ (I’m saying). ‘May I never stir’ introduces
some peculiarly solemn assertion. ‘A
month of Sundays,’ and still more strongly, ‘All
my born days,’ are emphatic expressions for long
periods of time. ‘Dear help your wit’ expresses
commiseration for the innocence and simplicity of
the person addressed.</p>

<p>Ulster adjurations are a curious medley, ‘Heth’
and ‘Feth’ being frequently used. ‘By Jaiminie
King’ is a curious expression often heard in
County Fermanagh. ‘Holy Farmer’ is another
obscure form of oath. ‘Hokey oh’ is a phrase
implying astonishment and alarm. ‘Hoker’ is
used by Chaucer to express frowardness, and
‘Hocer’ in Anglo-Saxon meant a reproach.
These words probably contain the clue to the
origin of this obscure Ulster provincialism.</p>

<p>Expressions conveying contempt or endearment
are common. ‘Bad scran to you’ is a
phrase of angry contempt. ‘Skran’ in Icelandic
means ‘refuse.’ Milton used the word ‘scrannel’
(‘scrannel pipes’) to express poor or mean; and
‘scranny’ still survives in provincial English in
this sense. ‘Bad cess to you’ is another Ulsterism
of similar meaning, of which the origin is
more doubtful; possibly ‘cess’ is a contraction
for success. ‘Give me none of your back-talk’
is said by a superior to an inferior, meaning,
‘Don’t presume to argue the question with me.’
A ‘Tory rogue’ is still commonly used in Ulster
in the sense of a scamp; but it is often applied
to children in a playful sense. It is an interesting
relic of the original meaning of the word
Tory—an Irish outlaw or freebooter. A ‘tongue-thrashing’
is a vigorous phrase for a severe
rebuke. ‘Carnaptious’ means quarrelsome and
fault-finding.</p>

<p>Some salutations are characteristic of the
northern province. ‘How do you get your
health?’ often takes the place of the more vague,
‘How do you do?’ ‘The top of the morning
to you’ is a cheery way of saying ‘Good-morrow.’</p>

<p>As might have been expected, there is a long
array of peculiar botanical and zoological expressions
characteristic of Ulster. Every district has
its local names for flowers, plants, birds, and
animals, and in these Ulster is peculiarly rich.
Potatoes are known as ‘spuds;’ ‘biller’ means
water-cress; ‘daffydowndillies’ is a lengthened
form of daffodils; ‘mayflower’ is the marsh
marigold or <i>Caltha palustris</i>. The heads of the
common plantain are called ‘cocks’ or ‘fighting-cocks,’
because children make a game of striking
them off in mimic warfare. The dock-plant is
called the ‘dockan’ (Scotch), and its leaf is a
popular remedy for nettle-sting; the wood-sorrel
is known as ‘cuckoo-sorrel.’</p>

<p>A still longer list of zoological terms might
be made out. The bottle-nosed whale is known
as the ‘herring-hog;’ the pollack is called ‘lythe;’
the lobworm used by fishermen for bait is called
the ‘lug;’ the stickleback has its name corrupted
into ‘spricklybeg;’ the gadfly is known as the
‘cleg’ (which is also its Scotch name); ‘yilly-yorlin’
(also Scotch) is the yellow-hammer; the
‘felt’ is the redwing; the ‘peeweet’ (Scotch
again) means the lapwing; the ‘mosscheeper’ is
the titlark; the cormorant is known as the
‘scart.’</p>

<p>We now turn to some provincialisms which
do not admit of a ready classification. ‘Bis’ is
often said for ‘is,’ and ‘bissent’ for ‘is not.’
Here we have an instance of a very common
phenomenon—an archaic form surviving as a
colloquialism or provincialism. A vast number
of our common vulgarisms which we are inclined
to regard as breaches of grammar are simply good
grammar out of date; in this case, the provincialism
almost exactly preserves a very ancient
form of the verb. The Anglo-Saxon verb ‘to be’
present tense indicative mood was ‘beom, bist,
bith,’ whence no doubt come ‘bis’ and ‘bissent.’
‘Braird,’ often used in Ulster, as in Scotland,
of the young springing grain, is the Anglo-Saxon
‘brord,’ meaning the first blade. ‘Buffer’ in
the sense of ‘boxer’ is from the old French
word ‘buffe,’ meaning a blow.</p>

<p>‘Chew, sir,’ is a form of rebuke applied to a
snarling dog. ‘Dwamish’ means faint and sick,
from ‘dwam,’ a Scotch word signifying a swoon
or a sudden attack of illness. ‘Dunt’ means a
blow, and is old English and Scotch; Burns
says, ‘I’ll tak dunts frae naebody.’ A ‘founder,’
according to our dictionaries, is a term in farriery
to indicate lameness caused by inflammation
within the hoof of a horse. In Ulster, the word
is often used to express a chill or wetting followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">{599}</span>
by illness. A man after being exposed to the
vicissitudes of weather becomes seriously ill
without knowing what is the matter, and he
expresses his condition by saying that he has
got ‘a regular founder.’ ‘Head-beetler’ is used
in the same vulgar sense as ‘Head-cook and
bottle-washer’ in some localities. The beetle was
a machine for producing figured fabrics by the
pressure of a roller, and ‘head-beetler’ probably
means the chief director of this class of work.
A ‘heeler’ is a cock which strikes out well with
his heels. In Ulster, the word is sometimes used
for a bold forward woman.</p>

<p>When a child begins to nod and look sleepy,
he is told that ‘Johnny Nod is coming up his
back,’ which is understood as a signal for going
to bed. ‘Potatoes and point’ is a curious phrase
in which the poverty of the lower classes in
Ireland finds unconscious expression. The idea is,
that the potatoes before being eaten are ‘pointed’
at a herring, which is hung up to serve as an imaginary
relish to the simple fare, but too precious
to be freely consumed. ‘Dab at the stool’ is
another expression referring to eating customs:
salt is placed upon a stool, and each individual,
as the potatoes are taken out of the pot,
takes one and ‘dabs’ it at the stool, to get
a portion of the salt. ‘Pouce’ and ‘poucey’
mean dust and dusty, but by a common perversion
of language, ‘poucey’ comes to mean a person
in a flax-mill who is exposed to the irritation
of dusty particles, and becomes in consequence
short-winded and bronchitic. ‘Roughness,’ as
in Scotland, means plenty. ‘Ruction’ signifies
a row, a disturbance; possibly it is a contraction
of ructation, from the Latin verb <i>ructare</i>.
‘Skelly,’ to squint, is from the Scotch, and is
found in Scott. The Danish is ‘skele.’ ‘Smittle,’
also used in Scotland, means infectious, and is connected
with the verb to smite. ‘Think long’
means to be homesick.</p>

<p>We thus see how much curious information
and how many relics of the past are found in
the despised vulgarisms of a provincial patois.
They are the fossils of language, and speak to
us of vanished peoples and of ages long gone
by.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days went slowly, slowly on, and Mr
Dupuy and Harry Noel both continued to recover
steadily from their severe injuries. Marian
came over every day to help with the nursing,
and took charge for the most part, with Aunt
Clemmy’s aid, of the young Englishman; while
Nora’s time was chiefly taken up in attending
to her father’s manifold necessities. Still at odd
moments she did venture to help a little in
taking care of poor Harry, whose gratitude for
all her small attentions was absolutely unbounded,
and very touching. True, she came comparatively
seldom into the sickroom (for such in fact
it was, the crushing blow on Harry’s head having
been followed by violent symptoms of internal
injury to the brain, which made his case far
more serious in the end than Mr Dupuy’s); but
whenever he woke up after a short doze, in his
intervals of pain, he always found a fresh passion-flower,
or a sweet white rosebud, or a graceful
spray of clambering Martinique clematis, carefully
placed in a tiny vase with pure water on
the little table by the bedside; and he knew
well whose dainty fingers had picked the pretty
blossoms and arranged them so deftly, with their
delicate background of lace-like wild West Indian
maiden-hair, in the tiny bouquets. More than
once, too, when Aunt Clemmy wasn’t looking, he
took the white rosebuds out of the water for a
single moment and gazed at them tenderly with
a wistful eye; and when, one afternoon, Marian
surprised him in the very act, as she came in
with his regulation cup of chicken-broth at the
half-hour, she saw that the colour rushed suddenly
even into his brown and bloodless cheek, and his
eyes fell like a boy’s as he replaced the buds
with a guilty look in the vase beside him. But
she said nothing about the matter at the time,
only reserving it for Nora’s private delectation
in the little boudoir half an hour later.</p>

<p>As Mr Dupuy got better, one firm resolve
seemed to have imprinted itself indelibly upon
his unbending nature—the resolve to quit Trinidad
for ever at the very earliest moment, when
convalescence and Macfarlane would combine to
allow him. He would even sell Orange Grove
itself, he said, and go over and live permanently
for the rest of his days in England. ‘That is
to say, in England for the summer,’ he observed
casually to Nora; ‘for I don’t suppose any human
being in his right senses would ever dream of
stopping in such a wretched climate through a
whole dreary English winter. In October, I
shall always go to Nice, or Pau, or Mentone,
or some other of these new-fashioned continental
wintering-places that people go to nowadays in
Europe; some chance, I suppose, of seeing the
sun once and again there, at anyrate. But one
thing I’ve quite decided upon: I won’t live
any longer in Trinidad. I’m not afraid; but I
object on principle to vivisection, especially conducted
with a blunt instrument. At my time
of life, a man naturally dislikes being cut up
alive by those horrible cutlasses. You and your
cousin Tom may stop here by yourselves and
manage Pimento Valley, if you choose; but I
decline any longer to be used as the <i>corpus vile</i>
for a nigger experimentalist to exercise his skill
upon. It doesn’t suit my taste, and I refuse
to submit to it. The fact is, Nora, my dear,
the island isn’t any longer a fit place for a gentleman
to live in. It was all very well in the old
days, before we got a pack of Exeter Hall demagogues,
sent out here by the government of the
day on purpose to excite our own servants to
rebellion and insurrection against us. Nobody
ever heard of the niggers rising or hacking one
to pieces bodily in those days. But ever since
this man Hawthorn, whose wife you’re so thick
with—a thing that no lady would have dreamt
of countenancing in the days before these new-fangled
doctrines came into fashion—ever since
this man Hawthorn was sent out here, preaching
his revolutionary cut-throat principles broadcast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">{600}</span>
the island hasn’t been a fit place at all for a
gentleman to live in; and I’ve made up my
mind to leave it at once and go over to England.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, events had arisen which rendered
it certain that the revolutionary demagogue himself,
who had saved Mr Dupuy’s life and all the
other white lives in the entire island, would also
have to go to England at a short notice. Edward
had intended, indeed, in pursuance of his hasty
promise to the excited negroes, to resign his
judgeship, and return home, in order to confer
with the Colonial Office on the subject of their
grievances. But before he had time to settle his
affairs and make arrangements for his approaching
departure, a brisk interchange of messages had
taken place between the Trinidad government and
the home authorities. Meetings had been held in
London at which the whole matter had been
thoroughly ventilated; questions had been asked
and answered in parliament; and the English
papers had called unanimously for a thorough
sifting of the relations between the planters and
the labourers throughout the whole of the West
India Islands. In particular, they had highly
praised the courage and wisdom with which
young Mr Hawthorn had stepped into the
breach at the critical moment, and single-handed,
averted a general massacre, by his timely influence
with the infuriated rioters. More than one
paper had suggested that Mr Hawthorn should
be forthwith recalled, to give evidence on the
subject before a Select Committee; and as a
direct result of that suggestion, Edward shortly
after received a message from the Colonial Secretary,
summoning him to London immediately,
with all despatch, on business connected with
the recent rising of the negroes in Trinidad.</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy had already chosen the date on
which he should sail; but when he heard that
‘that man Hawthorn’ had actually taken a passage
by the same steamer, he almost changed his
mind, for the first time in his life, and half
determined to remain in the island, now that
it was to be freed at last from the polluting
presence and influence of this terrible fire-eating
brown revolutionist. Perhaps, he thought, when
once Hawthorn was gone, Trinidad might yet
be a place fit for a gentleman to live in. The
Dupuys had inhabited Orange Grove, father and
son, for nine generations; and it would be a
pity indeed if they were to be driven away
from the ancestral plantations by the meddlesome
interference of an upstart radical coloured
lawyer.</p>

<p>In this dubitative frame of mind, then, Mr
Dupuy, as soon as ever Macfarlane would allow
him to mount his horse again, rode slowly down
from Orange Grove to pay a long-meditated call
at Government House upon His Excellency the
governor. In black frock-coat and shiny silk
hat, as is the rigorous etiquette upon such occasions,
even under a blazing tropical noontide,
he went his way with a full heart, ready to
pour forth the vials of his wrath into the sympathetic
ears of the Queen’s representative against
this wretched intriguer Hawthorn, by whose
Machiavellian machinations (Mr Dupuy was justly
proud in his own mind of that sonorous alliteration)
the happy and contented peasantry of the
island of Trinidad had been spurred and flogged
and slowly roused into unwilling rebellion against
their generous and paternal employers.</p>

<p>Judge of his amazement, therefore, when, after
listening patiently to his long and fierce tirade,
Sir Adalbert rose from his chair calmly, and
said in a clear and distinct voice these incredible
words: ‘Mr Dupuy, you unfortunately quite
mistake the whole nature of the situation. This
abortive insurrection is not due to Mr Hawthorn
or to any other one person whatever. It has long
been brewing; we have for months feared and
anticipated it; and it is the outcome of a widespread
and general discontent among the negroes
themselves, sedulously fostered, we are afraid’—here
Mr Dupuy’s face began to brighten with
joyous anticipation—‘by the unwise and excessive
severity of many planters, both in their
public capacity as magistrates, and in their
private capacity as employers of labour.’ (Here
Mr Dupuy’s face first fell blankly, and then
pursed itself up suddenly in a perfectly comical
expression of profound dismay and intense astonishment.)
‘It is to Mr Hawthorn alone,’ the
governor went on, glancing severely at the
astounded planter, ‘that many unwise proprietors
of estates in the island of Trinidad owe their
escape from the not wholly unprovoked anger
of the insurgent negroes; and so highly do the
home authorities value Mr Hawthorn’s courage
and judgment in this emergency, that they have
just summoned him back to England, to aid
them with his advice and experience in settling
a new <i>modus vivendi</i> to be shortly introduced
between negroes and employers.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy never quite understood how he
managed to reel out of the governor’s drawing-room
without fainting, from sheer astonishment
and horror; or how he managed to restrain his
legs from lifting up his toes automatically against
the sacred person of the Queen’s representative.
But he did manage somehow to stagger down
the steps in a dazed and stupefied fashion, much
as he had staggered along the path when he felt
Delgado hacking him about the body at the
blazing cane-houses; and he rode back home
to Orange Grove, red in the face as an angry
turkey-cock, more convinced than ever in his
own mind that Trinidad was indeed no longer
a fit place for any gentleman of breeding to live
in. And in spite of Edward’s having taken
passage by the same ship, he determined to clear
out of the island, bag and baggage, at the earliest
possible opportunity.</p>

<p>As for Harry Noel, he, too, had engaged a
berth quite undesignedly in the self-same steamer.
Even though he had rushed up to Orange Grove
in the first flush of the danger to protect Nora
and her father, if possible, from the frantic rioters,
it had of course been a very awkward position
for him to find himself an unwilling and uninvited
guest in the house which he had last quitted
under such extremely unpleasant circumstances.
Mr Dupuy, indeed, though he admitted, when
he heard the whole story, that Harry had no
doubt behaved ‘like a very decent young fellow,’
could not be prevailed upon to take any notice of
his unbidden presence, even by sending an occasional
polite message of inquiry about his slow
recovery from the adjoining bedroom. So Harry
was naturally anxious to get away from Orange
Grove as quickly as possible, and he had made up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">{601}</span>
his mind that before he went he would not again
ask Nora to reconsider her determination. His
chivalrous nature shrank from the very appearance
of trading upon her gratitude for his brave
efforts to save her on the evening of the outbreak;
if she would not accept him for his own
sake, she should not accept him for the sake of
the risk he had run to win her.</p>

<p>The first day when Harry was permitted to
move out under the shade of the big star-apple
tree upon the little grass plot, where he sat in
a cushioned bamboo chair beside the clump of
waving cannas, Nora came upon him suddenly,
as if by accident, from the Italian terrace, with
a bunch of beautiful pale-blue plumbago and a
tall spike of scented tuberose in her dainty,
gloveless, little fingers. ‘Aren’t they beautiful,
Mr Noel?’ she said, holding them up to his
admiring gaze—admiring them, it must be confessed,
a trifle obliquely. ‘Did you ever in
your life see anything so wildly lovely in a
stiff, tied-up, staircase conservatory over yonder
in dear old England?’</p>

<p>‘Never,’ Harry Noel answered, with his eyes
fixed rather on her blushing face than on the
luscious pale white tuberose. ‘I shall carry
away with me always the most delightful reminiscences
of beautiful Trinidad and of its lovely—flowers.’</p>

<p>Nora noticed at once the significant little pause
before the last word, and blushed again, even
deeper than ever. ‘Carry away with you?’ she
said regretfully, echoing his words—‘carry away
with you? Then do you mean to leave the
island immediately?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Miss Dupuy—immediately; by the next
steamer. I’ve written off this very morning
to the agents at the harbour to engage my
passage.’</p>

<p>Nora’s heart beat violently within her. ‘So
soon!’ she said. ‘How very curious! And how
very fortunate, too, for I believe papa has taken
berths for himself and me by the very same
steamer. He’s gone to-day to call on the governor;
and when he comes back, he’s going to
decide at once whether or not we are to leave
the island immediately for ever.’</p>

<p>‘Very fortunate? You said very fortunate?
How very kind of you. Then you’re not altogether
sorry, Miss Dupuy, that we’re going to
be fellow-passengers together?’</p>

<p>‘Mr Noel, Mr Noel! How can you doubt it?’</p>

<p>Harry’s heart beat that moment almost as fast
as Nora’s own. In spite of his good resolutions—which
he had made so very firmly too—he
couldn’t help ejaculating fervently: ‘Then you
forgive me, Miss Dupuy! You let bygones be
bygones! You’re not angry with me any
longer!’</p>

<p>‘Angry with you, Mr Noel—angry with you!
You were so kind, you were so brave! how could
I ever again be angry with you!’</p>

<p>Harry’s face fell somewhat. After all, then,
it was only gratitude. ‘It’s very good of you
to say so,’ he faltered out tremulously—‘very
good of you to say so. I—I—I shall always
remember—my—my visit to Orange Grove with
the greatest pleasure.’</p>

<p>‘And so shall I,’ Nora added in a low voice,
hardly breathing; and as she spoke, the tears
filled her eyes to overflowing.</p>

<p>Harry looked at her once more tenderly. How
beautiful and fresh she was, really! He
looked at her, and longed just once to kiss her.
Nora’s hand lay close to his. He put out his
own fingers, very tentatively, and just touched
it, almost as if by accident. Nora drew it half
away, but not suddenly. He touched it again,
a little more boldly this time, and Nora permitted
him, unreproving. Then he looked hard
into her averted tearful eyes, and said tenderly
the one word, ‘Nora!’</p>

<p>Nora’s hand responded faintly by a slight
pressure, but she answered nothing.</p>

<p>‘Nora,’ the young man cried again, with sudden
energy, ‘if it is love, take me, take me. But if
it is only—only the recollection of that terrible
night, let me go, let me go, for ever!’</p>

<p>Nora held his hand fast in hers with a tremulous
grasp, and whispered in his ear, almost
inaudibly: ‘Mr Noel, it is love—it is love! I
love you—indeed I love you!’</p>

<p>When Macfarlane came his rounds that evening
to see his patients he declared that Harry Noel’s
pulse was decidedly feverish, and that he must
have been somehow over-exciting himself; so
he ordered him back again ruthlessly to bed at
once till further notice.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was my good fortune, a great many years ago,
to be cantoned at Julbarri. I say ‘good fortune,’
for so I considered it; but I am afraid, if you
had asked at our mess for votes as to whether
I ought to qualify the word fortune with the
adjective ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ I should have got very
few to vote for my word. Good fortune I considered
it, nevertheless; for I was an ardent
sportsman; Julbarri was almost untried ground;
and the neighbouring jungles abounded in game
of many kinds, among which the rhinoceros, the
tiger, and the leopard were by no means few
and far between. And yet I cannot deny that
for any one who was not a sportsman, Julbarri
was about as slow a station as could be picked
out in all the length and breadth of our vast
Indian empire. It was situated in an out-of-the-way
corner of Bengal; and there was no large
station within a couple of hundred miles of us
where a man with social and gregarious tastes
could go for a few days to get rid of the oft-told
tales and well thrashed-out politics of the
limited circle of our small mess-table. Julbarri
was, alas, a single-corps station; and except a
Civil officer or two, the whole society consisted
of the gallant British officers of the distinguished
76th Native Infantry; a nice set of fellows
enough, I allow; but still the best of listeners
must in time grow inattentive to Smith’s ideas
on the comparative merits of Arab and English
horses; and it is difficult to wage any real warfare
with Jones as he challenges you for the
hundredth time to defend Lord Gough’s tactics
at Chilianwalla.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write, our society was
at a peculiarly low ebb. The drill season was
over; the hot weather was coming on; and the
leave season had begun. There was so little
work to be done, that our colonel had taken
pity on our isolation, and had been unusually,
perhaps almost unauthorisedly, liberal in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">{602}</span>
matter of leave; and our mess, small enough at
its best, had dwindled and dwindled, until now
not more than half-a-dozen unfortunates daily
stretched their legs beneath its well-spread mahogany.
For me, the approaching heat had no
terrors, the smallness of our society no ennui,
and the prospect of escape from Julbarri no
charms; for the beginning of the hot weather
is the very time when the best shooting can be
obtained, and I had long been watching the
drying up of the grass in the jungles, and had
been looking forward to the time when we might
start a tiger with some chance of bagging him.
There was one thing in which we were particularly
fortunate: we had attached to our regiment
nine elephants as a part of our regimental
transport. I need scarcely say that it was not long
before we had the elephants and their mahouts
(drivers) thoroughly trained for shooting. The
largest elephants we trained to carry our howdahs,
and the smaller we used to form a line to beat
the jungles and drive out the game. With these
elephants we had lots of fun, and there were
few weeks after the shooting season began in
which some of us did not go out two or three
times. We generally took it in turns; four of
us went out, and two remained behind to look
after the regiment and the station.</p>

<p>We kept three or four shikarees (native hunters),
who were constantly going about the villages and
jungles within a radius of six or seven miles of
cantonments; and as soon as they heard of a
tiger having killed a bullock or any other animal,
or as soon as they discovered the fresh footmarks
of any animal worth going after, they would come
in and give the <i>khubber</i> (news); and then those
whose turn it was would send the elephants
and their arms on towards where the game had
been seen, and would follow themselves on
horseback as quickly as possible. The best kind
of <i>khubber</i> was when a bullock or any other large
animal had been killed. The tiger usually prowls
round some village or some place where cattle
is pastured and kept for the night; and when
he sees his opportunity, will spring on some
unfortunate animal which has got separated from
the rest of the herd, or has remained out too
late in the jungle, heedless of the herdsman’s
call home, will kill it with a blow of his paw,
and drag it into some neighbouring jungle thicker
and denser than that immediately around the
village.</p>

<p>Nothing shows more the marvellous strength
possessed by the tiger than the way in which he
carries his victim away. I remember the first
time I was shown where a tiger had dragged
a full-grown bullock. I could not believe it
possible; and it was not until after we had
killed the robber—only an ordinary-sized tigress—and
I had carefully gone over on foot the ground
where she had dragged her prey, that I found
that she had not only dragged the dead bullock—an
animal, I should think, considerably beyond
her own weight—over very rough ground and
through a dense cane-brake; but that in some
places, as the marks showed, she must actually
have lifted the fore-quarters of the bullock off
the ground in her mouth, and have walked
several yards with it in that position. When
the victim has been dragged to what the tiger
considers a position of security, it will sit down
and make a good meal, and then retire a short
distance from its prey to some particularly thick
bush or tuft of grass, and there remain until
the following night, and then return for another
meal. In consequence of this well-known habit,
‘a kill,’ as it is called, is the best of all <i>khubber</i>,
and in such cases, if the tiger has not been disturbed,
the sportsman is almost sure to find him
lying somewhere close to the carcase; and if his
arrangements are well made, is pretty sure to get
a shot at him.</p>

<p>Our shikarees, stimulated by liberal backsheesh
when their news resulted in a bag, used often to
bring us in <i>khubber</i>; but sometimes the news was
not very good; and when this was the case,
the less ardent sportsmen of our number would
frequently refuse to go out, and would make
over their turn to me. I never refused, for I
was young and enthusiastic enough to love the
fun and the excitement of the hunt, even when
our expedition resulted in no bag; and did not
care for the chaff with which my sedater comrades
would greet me on my return. Sometimes, however,
the laugh was on my side; but I was wise
enough, with a view to future contingencies, not
to indulge in it too much.</p>

<p>We had been having very fair sport on and
off for about six weeks, and the animals in the
jungles close around the station seemed to have
been all killed off or driven away; for a whole
week passed, and no <i>khubber</i> good enough to
tempt even me did our shikarees bring. It was
the seventh blank day, and as we sat at our <i>chota
hazri</i> (early morning cup of some invigorating but
harmless beverage), under the shade of a splendid
mango-tree which grew conveniently close to
our messhouse veranda, my chum and I were
discussing the necessity of taking a week’s trip
across the river which skirted our station, and
were trying to cajole our companions into letting
us have the use of the elephants for so long a
time. We had nearly succeeded in persuading
them of the uselessness of expecting to get any
more shooting close to Julbarri, and two of the
least enthusiastic of our Nimrods had actually
given in, when into the compound and right
up to our table who should dash but Jamala,
the very best and most trustworthy of all our
shikarees! Almost breathless, he stammered out:
‘Sahib, sahib, two such huge tigers! Their pugs
are as big as that;’ and he described with the
end of the stick he held in his hand a figure
in the dust, intended to portray the size of their
footprints, which would have done credit to
a well-grown mammoth. ‘They have killed a
bullock in the Kala jungle, only six miles off;
and I am sure they were still there when I left
half an hour ago. I ordered the elephants to
be got ready as I passed the lines.’</p>

<p>Here was news with a vengeance; but alas,
it was my turn to stay in cantonments; and
with such splendid <i>khubber</i> as this I could not, of
course, even hint the suggestion of an exchange.
It was the custom of those going out, to borrow
all the firearms of those remaining behind; so
I and Castleton, who was my comrade in misfortune,
made over our Joe Manton guns and our
Purdeys to our luckier companions, and wished
them good speed with the best grace we could
muster; and if we betrayed our feelings a little
by throwing after them the parting exhortation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">{603}</span>
‘Mind you don’t miss the fifteen-footer,’ well, I
really think we ought to be forgiven.</p>

<p>Castleton was a married man; and I must
crave the ladies’ pardon for omitting in my list
of our Julbarri residents the really charming
Mrs Castleton and her fascinating sister, Miss
Jervoise. As soon as the hunters had gone,
Castleton turned to me, and said: ‘You had
better come over and lunch with us, Watson.
You’ll only be breaking your heart over visions
of those two fabulously footed tigers, if you
lunch at mess alone.’</p>

<p>I thanked him; and two o’clock found me
receiving the commiserations of the two fair
ladies, while they pressed upon me the usual
profuse hospitality of an Indian luncheon. We
had reached the dessert stage, and Mrs Castleton
was just pressing me to taste some specially
delicious plantains which a neighbouring rajah
had sent her the day before, when the bearer
came in, and making a salaam, said to Castleton:
‘A man has just come from that little hamlet
of Goree; he wants the sahib log to go out and
shoot a leopard which has just killed one of his
kids, and is now lying eating it in a small patch
of jungle. Goree is only a mile and a half from
here.’</p>

<p>We stared blankly at each other.</p>

<p>‘What can we do?’ said Castleton.</p>

<p>‘Do? Why, go and shoot it, of course!’
exclaimed the enthusiastic Miss Jervoise.</p>

<p>‘But, Kate dear,’ broke in Mrs Castleton with
wifely solicitude, ‘the elephants are all away,
and how can they shoot it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am not thinking about the elephants,’
replied Castleton; ‘but Watson and I have lent
all our rifles and guns, and we haven’t a single
thing of any kind left.’</p>

<p>‘There are the sepoys’ rifles,’ I suggested. ‘We
could take one of them apiece; and, you know,
we can’t let the leopard get off without having
a try for him. Can we?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, there are the sepoys’ rifles, certainly,’
replied Castleton rather doubtfully; ‘but’——</p>

<p>‘And I have got a couple of spears,’ I interrupted.
‘Oh, do let us go at once, before he is
disturbed.’</p>

<p>‘Well—all right; we’ll try it,’ said Castleton
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>I lost no time in running home and changing
into a shooting costume. Castleton sent his
orderly off to the lines for our weapons; and by
the time I had returned with the spears, the
orderly reappeared with a couple of rifles and
a packet of cartridges. So, a very short time saw
us mounted on our horses and following our
guide out to the little village of Goree.</p>

<p>‘I am not very sure about the wisdom of
this business,’ said Castleton.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it will be all right,’ I replied. ‘We must
be careful not to fire until we are pretty sure
to kill—that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘Hm, yes, I suppose so,’ assented my comrade
somewhat doubtfully.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was not an overwise
business. Our regiment was armed in those days
with the short two-grooved Brunswick rifle, a
muzzle loader, of course, and one in which the
bullet had to be hammered into the muzzle with
a small wooden hammer carried for the purpose,
before it could be rammed down with the ramrod.
This rendered the process of loading so dreadfully
slow that practically it would make it quite
impossible for either of us to get more than one
shot, and it is no easy matter to kill a leopard
with one bullet, however well placed. If he
were not killed, he would be pretty certain to
charge, and we should be in an awkward plight.</p>

<p>Matters did not look much more encouraging
when we reached Goree. The <i>khubber</i> was good
enough: there was the place where the kid had
been struck, and there were the drops of blood and
footprints of a large leopard leading into a patch
of dense cane-jungle about one hundred yards
long and sixty yards broad, and we had very
little doubt that he was in there, sure enough.
We arranged, somewhat rashly, that we would
enter the jungle from nearly opposite ends of the
patch and work towards the centre. If either
of us saw the leopard, we were, if possible, first
to whistle and then to call out before shooting.
We did this with a double object—first, that we
might not shoot each other; and secondly, that if
one of us wounded the beast and he came towards
the other, we might be on the lookout for him,
and not be taken unawares. So we separated;
and I cautiously entered the left end of the
patch, while Castleton made his entrance on the
right. My end of the jungle was thicker than
Castleton’s; but the edge was fairly clear, and
by peering under the brake, I could see four or
five yards in front of me. Very soon, the cane
and bushes became so dense that I had to clear
away the leaves with one hand while I held the
rifle ready cocked in the other. We had each a
sepoy accompanying us and carrying our second
weapon, the spear. To my man I gave instructions
that the moment I fired, I would hand
him back the rifle, and he was to give me the
spear. Of course I kept him behind me, so that
he should be in no danger. We had not begun
our advance more than two or three minutes,
and had not penetrated, at our slow and cautious
pace, more than about twenty yards, when
Castleton whistled. I at once stood still. After
a slight pause, he called out in a sort of stage
whisper: ‘I see him; but it’s a nasty shot. I
can only see his hind-quarters, and there is a
lot of jungle in the way. Shall I shoot?’</p>

<p>‘Fire away,’ I replied, in an equally melodramatic
tone, heartily wishing that his chance
had been mine. In about half a minute the
report of Castleton’s rifle rang out. It was followed
by an angry roar somewhere from my
right front, and there was a dead silence. The
smoke from Castleton’s rifle came floating over
my head; but though I listened intently with
my rifle half raised to my shoulder, not the
sound of a footstep or the cracking of a twig
could I hear. At last Castleton called out:
‘I’ve hit him, but not badly, I think; and
he has gone off in your direction.’</p>

<p>Giving Castleton time to reload, I again began
moving forward with even greater caution than
before. I had advanced only a few paces, when
on pushing aside a screen of leaves thicker than
usual, and thrusting my head into a bush, I
met a sight that made my heart jump: there,
within about six feet of me, crouched the leopard,
his eyeballs glowing like balls of green fire in
the dark jungle, a look of the most savage mischief
on his face, and evidently just on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">{604}</span>
point of springing straight at me. My first
impulse was to throw my rifle to my shoulder
and fire at once; but more quickly than a
flash of lightning came the conviction, like a
living voice speaking in me: ‘If you do, and
if you don’t kill him dead, he’ll kill you.’ My
nerves seemed to grow steady at once, and I
checked my first rash impulse. Then keeping
my eye fixed on his, I raised my rifle slowly
and deliberately, took a steady aim, and fired.
A dull groan and a desperate convulsion followed,
and then in half a minute all was still. My
faithful sepoy had duly obeyed my instructions;
he had taken my rifle and had given me the
spear, and with this spear held at the charge,
ready to receive the leopard if he came my way,
we waited until the convulsion subsided. Then
peering in again, we found that the leopard had
gone back; and it was not until we had advanced
some ten yards that we came upon him lying
dead. It shows the marvellous vitality of the
feline race; for though the ball was a heavy
one, and had crashed right through the brain,
yet he had managed to go fully eight yards
from where he was crouching. Had the ball
been turned aside at all by a twig, or had
it glanced off his skull, he would almost
certainly have made his spring, and in a jungle
so dense I could hardly have hoped to keep
him off or defend myself.</p>

<p>I called up Castleton at once, and we soon
pulled the leopard out of the thicket. We found
Castleton’s bullet had hit him in the side, but
far back, so as not to interfere in any way
with his powers of attack. I congratulated myself
on a lucky escape. The villagers were
delighted at the death of a robber which had
more than once laid their flocks under contribution,
and pressed their services on us to carry
him home. A procession was soon formed, and
we returned to Julbarri in triumph with the
leopard swung on a pole in front of us. The
other hunters had not returned; so we had
ample time to exhibit our prize to the sympathetic
eyes of Mrs Castleton and Miss Jervoise.
In about an hour, the others returned, wearied
and disgusted. The tigers had been disturbed
before their arrival, and had betaken themselves
to some very heavy jungle, whence, in spite
of their best efforts, they were unable to dislodge
them. It required a lot of good feeling
on their part to make them congratulate us
as heartily as they did; and I hope our sympathy
with their ill-luck showed itself quite
untinged with any sense of our own better
fortune.</p>

</div>


<h3 title="CHAP. III.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the next three months, Mr
Blackford’s relations with his crazy client
Willoughby entered upon a somewhat uncomfortable
phase. He had continued his heartless game
with the poor wretch, entertaining him with
purely imaginative accounts of the superhuman
exertions which were being made on his behalf,
and bleeding him with a rapacity which grew
with each successive extortion. He had in this
way obtained nearly a hundred pounds, when
something happened which he might have foreseen
had he not been blinded by his greed, and
which caused him to entertain very unpleasant
misgivings. Had Willoughby been a sane man,
pursuing a sane object, these repeated demands
for money, unaccompanied by any tangible performance,
would have aroused suspicions which
would have manifested themselves in the usual
manner. But being as he was, his disease coloured
everything which happened to him; and the
perfectly natural suspicions which arose in his
mind made themselves heard only by the mocking
voices of his airy persecutors. So one
morning he informed Mr Blackford that the
persons who followed him wherever he went had
adopted fresh tactics.</p>

<p>‘They have managed to find out what I come
here for,’ said he, ‘and they are trying to frighten
me out of doing so in a very curious way. In
fact,’ he continued with an uneasy laugh, ‘they
have taken to slandering you as well.’</p>

<p>‘And what are they good enough to say about
me?’ inquired the solicitor, in much surprise.</p>

<p>‘Of course I pay no attention to it. I have
every confidence in you; I am sure you are doing
the best you can for me—as you are, are you
not?’ added the unfortunate client, with a look
of pitiful appeal, which would have softened the
heart of any but a necessitous and perfectly
unprincipled man. As it was, Mr Blackford
experienced an unpleasant spasm in the place
where his conscience used to be, before it had
dwindled away like an unused muscle.</p>

<p>‘Of course I am,’ he replied. ‘I hope you
don’t doubt it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, certainly not; on the contrary,’ returned
Willoughby, with a courteous bow. ‘But last
night they mentioned your name in a most
unpleasant way. “He went to the wrong man
when he went to Blackford.” That was what one
of them said. And another answered: “Yes,
Blackford is altogether on our side. He’ll spend
all his money on Blackford, and get no good
whatever.” And they said—they said—— I can’t
remember everything; but it was all to the same
effect. Of course that kind of thing makes a
man uneasy—naturally. Isn’t it disgraceful that
the law can do nothing to protect one from such
persecution?’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford thought it best to laugh the
matter off. ‘Well,’ said he jocularly, ‘if we can
but catch sight of them, I’ll soon disabuse them
of any such idea.—Don’t you pay any attention
to their nonsense. Of course they would like
to put you off the scent. The rascals! I’d give
a good deal to get fairly at them. It won’t be
long, now, before I do so. We are well on their
track; and once we have them before the magistrate,
we’ll pay them out for all the trouble
they’ve given us.’</p>

<p>Willoughby rose to go. ‘I hope, as you say,
that it will not be long now,’ said he, with a
doubtful and dissatisfied air. ‘You see, it is
wearing me out, and I have spent a good deal of
money over it, besides. One of them threatened
to kill me last night. If anything of that kind
is to be attempted, they won’t find me an easy
victim, Mr Blackford! I shall try to be beforehand
with them, at anyrate. I’m not a man to
be played with too long.’</p>

<p>And there was a look in the madman’s eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">{605}</span>
as he spoke, and a kind of quiver through
his brawny muscles, which seemed to say that
the moment was fast approaching when playing
with him would be a very risky amusement
indeed.</p>

<p>‘By George!’ said the solicitor to himself,
wiping his forehead, when he was once more
alone, ‘this is getting rather too warm. The
fellow gave me quite a turn. If he takes <i>that</i>
notion into his head, things may become awkward.’
And Mr Blackford decided that the time had
arrived for communicating with Willoughby’s
friends in Cape Town. He would have tried to
induce the police to move in the matter at once;
but this remedy, as he knew, was difficult and
uncertain, and should it fail, would but add to
the danger. He wrote off then and there, representing
in feeling language the condition of
his unfortunate client, which he stated he had
only just discovered, and urging that some one
should come to England immediately, with a view
to putting the lunatic’s person and property
under proper control. Of course he said nothing
about the money he had extorted for his phantom
services. Fortunately, it was against his principles
to give receipts unless they were demanded,
which in this case they had not been, and all
the payments had been made in cash; so he left
it to be inferred that his exertions had been
gratuitously rendered entirely from a sense of
duty, and delicately hinted at their continuance
on a different footing. Practice ‘In Lunacy’ is
very lucrative; and Mr Blackford was not the
man to neglect such chances as came in his
way.</p>

<p>After this, owing to certain instructions which
Mr Blackford gave to his staff, Willoughby found
it surprisingly difficult to obtain a satisfactory
interview with his solicitor. If he made an
appointment by letter, Mr Blackford had always
been unavoidably called out, and the time of
his return was certain only in that it would be
very late. If the client called unexpectedly, he
always found the lawyer putting on his hat
and gloves in a violent hurry, to attend some
important appointment; and the interview was
restricted to a short conversation as they walked
through the streets, with ready assistance at hand
on all sides. Willoughby’s manner under this
treatment grew more and more unsatisfactory.
Jobson, the clerk, who knew nothing of the
business in hand, never suspected the visitor’s
peculiar condition, and cheerfully assured him,
according to orders, that all was going on well.
But this did not satisfy him; and on the few
occasions of his seeing the lawyer in person, he
made that gentleman extremely uncomfortable by
the growing gloom and wildness of his looks,
and by persistent references to the hints of
treachery which his mysterious foes continued
to throw out.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he discontinued his visits. A fortnight
went by, during which he made no sign;
and then something happened which drove him
entirely out of Mr Blackford’s mind. This was
the receipt of a letter written by Lucy Wedlake,
at the request of her uncle, who wished to see
his solicitor at once on important business. It
was added that Mr Franklin had been seriously
ill, but was now much better, and it was hoped
that with care he would soon recover.</p>

<p>Mr Blackford found his client in his bedroom,
propped up with pillows in a chair by the fireside.
It was evident at the first glance that
he had received a heavy blow. His face was
anxious and watchful, like that of one who
expects from hour to hour the advent of a
dreaded enemy, and fears to be taken unprepared.
It was with little trace of his ordinary rough
irritability, and with a tremulous and feeble
voice, that he bade the solicitor sit down, for
there was a deal to talk about. He had had ‘an
attack,’ he said; the doctors told him it was the
heart, and he must be very careful. They had
to say something for their money, of course; still,
it might be true. We must all go some time;
and his time might be short. He had committed
an injustice, which must be put right at once.
His niece had done her duty by him, and he
had broken his promise to her. It was his wish
to make a fresh will at once, leaving her the
whole of his property, according to his original
intention.</p>

<p>‘I’ve planned it all in my mind,’ said he. ‘It
is to be for her alone, mind you; her husband
shall never touch a penny that I can keep from
him. He’s an impudent upstart. He spoke to
me as no man ever ventured to speak before;
and I doubt he’s brought me to my grave,
through being upset the way I was. Take that
pen and paper, Blackford, and set it down just
as I tell you. The money is to be invested, and
the income to be paid to my niece Lucy Wedlake
as long as she lives; after her death, the capital
is to be divided equally among the children.
If she has no children, it’s all to go to the
Vintners’ Company. That cuts out Thomas
Wedlake, doesn’t it? That’s all right.—Now
about yourself. I suppose you consider that you’re
an injured man, don’t you—hey?’</p>

<p>To this question, put with some approach to
Uncle Franklin’s usual manner and tone, Mr
Blackford found it difficult, in the then state of
his emotions, to make any reply whatever. He
managed to stammer out, with a ghastly attempt
at a smile, that he was aware that he had no
right to expect——</p>

<p>‘No more you had,’ interrupted Mr Franklin;
‘that’s very true; so there’s little harm done.
Though I don’t say but what I’ll do something
for you too. That has happened to me which
makes a man think of things he usen’t to mind.
Maybe I’ve no right to disappoint you altogether,
after what I led you to expect. I might have
employed another lawyer to make this will; but
I thought you were entitled to have what business
was to be got out of the thing. And you
shan’t say I was unhandsome. Put yourself
down for a thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford expressed his gratitude as well
as he could, which was not very well; but it
was a great deal more than he felt under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>‘You have named no trustees,’ said he, recovering
himself a little; ‘it will be necessary to do
so. I myself should be very happy’——</p>

<p>‘No,’ said the old man; ‘I don’t care for
lawyers as trustees; they never seem to run
straight. Let me see—put down William Brown,
of the Stock Exchange, and James Harberton, of
Leadenhall Street, merchant. Give them each a
hundred pounds for their services. They won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">{606}</span>
refuse to act when they find their names in the
will; if they were to be asked beforehand, they’d
say no; so don’t you tell either of them till I’m
gone. And talking of that—don’t let my niece
or any one else hear a word about this. I shall
keep the will myself this time, and you will be
the only person to know where it is to be found.
Otherwise, they’ll all be scrabbling after it as
soon as the breath is out of me—perhaps before;
and it may be a whim, but I don’t like the
notion. Lucy’s a good sort; but then she is
only a woman, and curious, like the rest of
’em. I shall tell her to send for you when the
right time comes; and then you can lay your
hand upon the will and do what’s needful—which
will bring a little more grist to your
mill, to console you. Get the thing ready by
to-morrow at this time, and bring it here with
two witnesses, as before. Bring the old will as
well; I wish to destroy it myself.’</p>

<p>‘That is hardly necessary,’ said the solicitor,
catching at he knew not what straw of hope;
‘it will be effectually revoked by the later
document.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you argue with me; do as I tell you.
I say I shall destroy it with my own hands;
then there can’t be any question about it.—Don’t
fail to come to-morrow; I want to get
it over. I don’t think there’s much time to
waste. If you were to take me anywhere near
a churchyard and lay me down, I doubt I
shouldn’t be in a hurry to get up again.’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford attempted a politely deprecatory
murmur, but was testily interrupted. ‘Oh, I
daresay you won’t be sorry to get your money.
I’m tired talking. Mind you do just as I
have told you.—Good-day.’</p>

<p>It was not until he found himself sitting in his
own room, staring blankly at the opposite wall,
that the solicitor realised the full weight of his
misfortune. He had no feeling of anger; the
blow, though he had all along had a lurking
presentiment of it, was too cruel and staggering,
now that it had fallen, to arouse any such
emotion. He was bitterly disappointed. A thousand
pounds! But a few months ago, a thousand
pounds would have seemed a fortune, and the
windfall would have set him planning innumerable
ways of turning it to the best advantage.
But what was it now to him, who had
been deprived of the expectation of a sum which
would have rendered all planning unnecessary,
only to be resorted to as a recreation, for the
remainder of his life? Nothing, and worse than
nothing—a mere tantalising taste of the good fortune
which ought in justice—so it really appeared
to him—to have been his. And must he now
give up all his hopes? Must he remain for
ever a mere plodding man of business of doubtful
reputation—even with a thousand pounds of
capital? Were the delights of unlimited leisure,
of freedom from thought for the morrow, of
unstinted gratification of animal appetites, of
worldly consideration, never to be his, after all?
He was fast approaching middle life; the time
remaining to him for the enjoyment of all these
things was growing shorter and shorter. To the
purer pleasures of honest labour, to the noble
ambition of building up a modest fortune by
dauntless perseverance and undeviating rectitude,
in the hope that some day, with folded hands,
he might fearlessly await the end in the quiet
of an old age free from reproach—to all this he
was utterly a stranger; nor would the prospect,
had it been suggested, have at all allured him.
His life had been one of poverty tempered by
knaveries too petty to attract punishment; his
dream of success had been one of sudden and
unearned wealth, coming without effort, to be
applied only to selfish gratification. To such
men, crime, as crime, presents nothing repulsive;
they abstain from it only so long as it offers no
advantage commensurate with the risk. Given
advantage and opportunity, crime follows with
the certainty of a mathematical demonstration.
He would not give way without a struggle.
He could not. Something must be done. But
what?</p>

<p>He opened his safe, and took out the will
which was to have made him rich, and by that
time to-morrow would be a mere piece of waste
paper. He read it through, dwelling on every
word with the bitterness of one who takes
leave of hope for ever. When he came to the
end, he gave a slight start of surprise—the
date was blank. It had been left blank, he
remembered, when the document was signed.
He had intended to fill it in on his return
to the office, but he had forgotten to do so.
It should have been the 28th of November.
What did it matter now! He threw the will
on his desk with a despairing gesture, and
walked up and down, trying to think. His
brain was in a whirl; he could see no loophole
of escape from the impending sacrifice.
Then he remembered—and it came to him as
an additional stab—that he had his bread to
earn; whatever else he might do, he must at
present carry out his client’s instructions. He
must with his own hands prepare the instrument
which was to rob him—so he put it to
himself—of his just expectations.</p>

<p>As he turned to the table, his eye again fell
upon the blank space at the end of the will
where the date should have been inserted; and
at that moment, the crime which was to come
to his aid stepped up softly behind him and
whispered its first hint into his ear.</p>

<p>It was a revelation. Mr Blackford, as he sat
and thought out the details, though by no means
a religious man, almost considered it to be providential.
No shrinking from the cruel wrong
he was about to commit, no sentiment of justice
or compassion interfered with his determination
to avail himself of it to its fullest extent. He
set to work at once. His first step was to walk
across to the law-stationer and inform him
that the writer who had witnessed a will on
a former occasion would be required for a like
service to-morrow. The testator, he explained,
was the same; he was making a fresh will;
he was an eccentric old gentleman, who insisted
that the very persons who had attested the old
will should also attest the new one; and he
took the precaution of seeing the writer himself
and making sure of his attendance. As he
went back to the office, he warned Jobson that
he, too, would be required for the same purpose.</p>

<p>He got down his books and set to work. He
drew the new will with the greatest care and
accuracy, according to the instructions which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">{607}</span>
had just received. Everything was vested in the
trustees named, in trust to pay the income to
the testator’s dear niece Lucy, the wife of Thomas
Wedlake, for her life, for her separate use, free
from the debts, control, or engagements of her
present or any future husband. After her death,
the fund was to be divided amongst her children
as she should direct; in default of children,
the whole to be paid to the Vintners’ Company
of London. Nothing was neglected; all the usual
and proper powers and provisos were inserted
with careful attention to detail.</p>

<p>The previous will he had fair-copied with
his own hand, instead of handing it to his
clerk or law-stationer. He did the same in this
case, though the document was longer and the
transcription involved considerable labour. His
next proceeding, in the eyes of another lawyer,
would have seemed very curious, for lawyers
are extremely particular about the preservation,
for future reference, of the draft of any deed
or other document which they prepare; but the
draft of this will Mr Blackford tore to fragments,
which he afterwards burned in the grate.
He was taking unusual pains, in fact, to carry
out the testator’s wishes, that no one beside
himself and his solicitor should be aware of the
contents of the will.</p>

<p>It was now past his usual lunch-time; and
he strolled into the outer office, and sent his
boy to get him a dry biscuit and a glass of
brandy-and-water. Until this arrived, he stood
chatting to Jobson on indifferent subjects; and
then intimating to him that he was going to
be extremely busy with private affairs, and must
not be disturbed on any account whatever, he
retired with his spare meal. He locked the
door of his room behind him; he was about to
enter on an important part of his operation. He
took up the old will—that which was to be
destroyed on the morrow—and examined it carefully
as he ate and drank. It was copied on
a piece of the paper known as ‘demy;’ it
occupied the whole of the first page and four
lines of the second. Then followed the long
and cumbrous attestation clause, with Mr Franklin’s
straggling and irregular signature against it.
Taking a paper of the same size, shape, and
quality, the solicitor made an exact and laboured
copy, or rather fac-simile. It had the same
number of lines, and each line contained the
same words as in the original. One or two
unimportant erasures and carelessly formed letters
were faithfully repeated. The signature, ‘Wm.
Franklin,’ was transferred by means of tracing
and carbonised paper, and then gone over and
touched up with the pen, until a most successful
imitation was produced. Two small blots, or
rather splutters, had been made by the testator
in writing his name. Their positions were accurately
ascertained by measurement, their outlines
transferred with the tracing-paper and then filled
in with ink; a final touch of which Mr Blackford
was reasonably proud, as indicating real genius.
The result was a duplicate, which only a very
careful scrutiny could have distinguished from the
original of the will which was in his own favour.
This ended his labours for the present.</p>

<p>Next day, Mr Blackford presented himself
and his two witnesses before his client with the
new will for signature. The old man, who was
in much the same condition, read it through for
himself and expressed his approval. The usual
formalities were gone through, and the witnesses
dismissed.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Mr Franklin, ‘have you brought
the other will?’</p>

<p>‘I have, as you requested me to do so,’ said the
solicitor, producing it; ‘though, as I said at the
time, it was not necessary.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said his client, taking it from his
hand; ‘it’s just as well out of the way. How do
I know what tricks a lawyer might be up to?’</p>

<p>To this speech, in Mr Franklin’s best style, the
solicitor made no reply; he was conscious of being
‘up to tricks’ of a rather elaborate nature. His
client read the revoked will through with the
same care as he had bestowed on that which superseded
it. When he came to the signature, something
about it seemed to arrest his attention; he
turned it to the light and inspected it closely.
Mr Blackford’s heart thumped uncomfortably
against his ribs.</p>

<p>‘Curious!’ said Mr Franklin slowly; ‘I never
knew myself to miss dotting an <i>i</i> before.’</p>

<p>He continued to pore over the signature,
making grumbling comments, in an undertone,
for some seconds, during which Mr Blackford
felt an almost irresistible desire to snatch the
document from him and knock his venerable
head against the wall. At last, to the solicitor’s
intense relief, he tore it across and across and
threw it upon the fire, where it was quickly
destroyed.</p>

<p>‘That’s done with,’ said Mr Franklin. ‘The
next thing is to put this one away where no one
but you and I will know where to find it. I
prefer to keep it here, because then I shall know
it’s all safe. As to the last, it didn’t so much
matter; you were the person most interested in
its safety, so it was very well that you should
have the custody of it. It’s different now.—D’ye
see that half-dozen of books on the shelf in the
recess? At this end, you’ll find a big old illustrated
Prayer-book. Put the will in there, and
remember the page.’</p>

<p>Mr Blackford took down the book, which
opened of itself—ominously enough—at the
service for the Burial of the Dead. He did
not mention this circumstance, but put the
folded paper in its place and closed and replaced
the volume.</p>

<p>‘That’s well,’ said Mr Franklin in a weary
voice. ‘I’m weaker than I thought; all this
has tired me out.—Good-bye, Blackford; shake
hands. You’ll do your part at the proper time;
I shall tell ’em to send for you. Don’t forget—the
old Prayer-book at this end of the shelf.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t forget,’ replied the lawyer; ‘but I
hope it may be many a long day yet before I am
called on to remember.—Good-bye, sir.’</p>

<p>Uncle Franklin did not reply; he was lying
back on his pillows with closed eyes; and so
Mr Blackford left him.</p>

<p>The first steps of his scheme had been well
planned, well carried out, and had met with
entire success. He had been obliged, it is true,
to forge a duplicate of the former will; but the
forgery had just been put out of evidence by the
testator himself. There was nothing to bear
witness against him on that score. There were
now two wills in existence, both bearing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">{608}</span>
testator’s genuine signature, both attested by the
same witnesses, and both dated—or shortly to
be dated—on the same day; the only difference
between them being the trifling one, that the will
which was between the leaves of the old Prayer-book
was in favour of Lucy Wedlake, while that
which remained in Mr Blackford’s possession constituted
him the sole legatee. The witnesses,
having merely signed their names to two documents
of very similar appearance on two different
occasions, would be quite unable to say which
they had last attested, for they knew nothing of
the contents of either.</p>

<p>So far, so good. What was to be the next step?
That, as Mr Blackford perceived, was a matter
requiring very careful consideration.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak smalltext" id="BIG_UNDERTAKINGS">BIG UNDERTAKINGS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Nothing seems too big for the present age, for
we are continually being startled with something
new and something immense, which has either
been just completed, or is about to be carried out,
or, at anyrate, is projected or proposed. Within
the last few weeks three new schemes have been
either commenced or suggested in Switzerland,
Greece, and Canada. The first-named scheme in
Switzerland is proposed by an Italian engineer
named Agudio, of Milan, for making a way
through the Simplon, which he declares he can
do by a tunnel of only six thousand and fifty
metres, the traction and haulage being done by
hydraulic power. He says that by this means
from three to four thousand tons of goods could
be safely transported without any breaking-up
or trans-shipment of trains; while the cost of
the whole proceeding would be only twenty-eight
millions of francs.</p>

<p>Number Two project consists of the bold but
practical scheme of draining the Lake of Copaïs,
near Thebes, in Bœotia, by which an area of a
hundred square miles will be added to the
territory of Greece. The acquiring of so very
large a piece of land, which may be put to useful
purposes, though undoubtedly one of vast importance,
is not the only object intended to be
effected by the proposal—the other being the
destruction of one of the greatest fever-producing
places in the country by reason of the pestilential
malaria always arising from the waters of this
lake. This alone would be an unspeakable blessing
to the country round, and money should be
readily forthcoming for the carrying out of so
beneficial an undertaking. The rivers now flowing
into the lake would be employed for irrigation
and other purposes of practical utility.</p>

<p>Number Three project proposes to connect
Prince Edward Island with the Canadian mainland
by means of a submarine railway tunnel, by
which all communication can be kept open with
the inhabitants of the island during the winter, a
circumstance at present almost impossible, from
the terribly rigorous nature of the winter climate
of Canada; but Canada is bound legally to do
everything that is possible to keep open a communication
with this island at all times and by
all means, for the accommodation and assistance
of the hundred and twenty-five thousand persons
who constitute the present population. The
distance of the island is only six miles and a
half, and the bed of the Northumberland Straits,
under which the railway will be carried, presents
no very apparent difficulties. The depth of water
is on the island side thirty-six feet; and ten
feet six inches on the New Brunswick side; and
about eighty feet in the middle. The tunnel
will be eighteen feet in diameter, and will be
made of ‘chilled white cast-iron,’ in sections,
these latter being bolted together with inside
flanges, exactly in the same way in which the
little tunnel for foot-passengers under the Thames,
and known as the ‘Tower Subway,’ was constructed
some years ago. The cost of this undertaking
is estimated at about one million sterling.
It has been well considered and highly commended,
and will be brought before the Canadian
parliament very speedily, when the scheme will
no doubt be fully sanctioned, as it has many
warm supporters in the Legislative Assembly.
Canada will therefore have her ‘submarine railway’
long before her illustrious ‘mother’ on this
side the Atlantic.</p>
